### Research experience

1. **Research Engineer** *(October 2017 - Present)*, Computational Linguistics Lab, Federal Research Center "Computer sciences and Control" of Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.

* Explored methods of word embeddings evaluation.
* Participated in a development of a Python module for word embeddings evaluation.
* Explored methods of cross-language information retrieval.

2. **Research Engineer** *(February 2017 - August 2017)*, Expasoft Ltd., Novosibirsk, Russia.

* Participated in a development of a goal-oriented conversational agent (chatbot) for Russian.
* Developed a rule-based named entity recognition module for slot filling using Python.
* Developed a paraphrase detection module using distributional semantics technique.
* Developed an anomaly detection module using Tensorflow for identifying off-topic utterances.


### Education

* **MA Computational Linguistics** *(2017 - 2019)*, The National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia.
* **BSc. Computer Science** *(2013 - 2017)*, Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia  (GPA 4.3).

### Relevant Skills

* **Computer Science:** My education and experience as a software engineer gave me such skills as alogrithms, object oriented design, patterns and development processes.
* **Linguistics:** My second degree in linguistics gave me a deep understanding of mechanisms of human language, like generative grammar, formal semantics and so on.
* **Stack:** I use *C/C++* for performance-critical code, along with such libraries and tools for machine learning as Eigen, CUDA, MeTA. Along with that, I use *Python* for high level scripting, quick prototyping and experiments. I am fluent with all popular machine learning and NLP Python modules such as pandas, scipy, numpy, scikit-learn, NLTK, pytorch, and so on.
* **Other:** I am using UNIX as a primary working system for more then 10 years, so I have a decent understanding of UNIX system administration; also I am familiar with version control systems (git) and databases (SQL).
