### Relevant skills

* **Computer Science:** My education and experience as a software engineer gave me such skills in computer science and software engineering as algorithms, object oriented design, patterns and development processes.
* **Linguistics:** My second degree in linguistics gave me a deep understanding of mechanisms of a human language, for instance, generative grammar, formal semantics and linguistic typology.
* **Stack:** I use C/C++ for performance-critical code, along with certain libraries for machine learning such as Eigen. Along with that, I use Python (scipy, numpy, pytorch, etc) for high-level scripting, quick prototyping and experiments.
* **Other:** I have a decent understanding of UNIX system administration, I am familiar with version control systems (git, svn) and databases (SQL). I have interest in cognitive sciences, and I know about key works, methods and recent advances in decision making and language processing. 
* **Natural Languages:** Russian (native), English (fluent).
