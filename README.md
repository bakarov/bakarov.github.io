### Relevant skills

* **Computer Science:** My education and work experience as a software engineer gave me such skills in computer science and software engineering as algorithms, object oriented design, patterns, architecture design and product understanding.
* **Linguistics**: My second degree in linguistics gave me a deep understanding of mechanisms of a human language, e.g. generative grammar, formal semantics and linguistic typology.
* **Stack:** I use C/C++ for performance-critical code, and Python (along with pytorch and numpy) for high-level scripting, quick prototyping, experiments and data analysis.
* **Other:** I have a decent understanding of UNIX system administration, I am familiar with version control systems (git, svn) and databases (SQL). I have interest in cognitive sciences, and I know about key works, methods and recent advances in fields of decision making and language processing. 
* **Natural Languages:** Russian (native), English (fluent).
